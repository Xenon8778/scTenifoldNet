Description: scTenifoldNet is a tool based on machine learning methods to construct and compare single-cell gene regulatory networks (scGRNs) using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected from different conditions. scTenifoldNet uses principal component regression, tensor decomposition, and manifold alignment, to accurately identify even subtly shifted gene expression programs.
