Description: PCrTdMa is a tool to construct single-cell gene regulatory networks (scGRNs) from scRNA-seq data sets collected from different conditions and compare them. PCrTdMa uses principal component regression, tensor decomposition, and manifold alignment, to accurately identify even subtly shifted gene expression programs.
